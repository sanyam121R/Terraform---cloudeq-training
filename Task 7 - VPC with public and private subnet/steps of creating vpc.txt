Step 1 : VPC
Step 2: Create Subnets
Step 3: Internet Gateway
Step 4: Create a 2nd Route Table
Step 5: Associating Public Subnets to the Second Route Table

vpc --> subnet --> create and attach primary ENI --> internet gateway and deafult route
--> create custom security group --> Create Inbound Rule to Allow Remote Access from Any IP Address
--> 




First you need to create VPC then plan and apply it 
then we need to write code for subnet and then plan n apply it

cli commands

* Create a new VPC
$ aws ec2 create-vpcâ€”cidr-block 172.16.0.0/16

* Create a new subnet
$ aws ec2 create-subnet-vpc-id [VPC resource ID] --cidr-block 172.16.100.0/24 --availability-zone us-east-1a 



DOUBTS

hi sir, i have this that 
- how can i create multiple instance while i have multiple subnets, 
  since we can't use for_each and count in the same resource block..

- I have read this blog https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-aws-vpc and 
  in this they have created public and private subnets in different azs
  so when i was creating the ec2 instance i needed the subnets_id and 
  the number of instances i need to loop through to create them.,
